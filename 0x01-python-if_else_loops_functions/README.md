# README

Welcome. This is the 0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions directory where I'm storing exercises showing the usage of conditionals, loops and functions in Python. Here are the files and its descriptions:

 - 0-positive_or_negative.py: Program printing if a random number is positive, negative or zero.
 - 1-last_digit.py: Program that prints if the last digit of a number is greater than 5, less than 6 and not 0, or 0.
 - 2-print_alphabet.py: Program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
 - 3-print_alphabt.py: Program that prints the alphabet without the letters 'e' and 'q'.
 - 4-print_hexa.py: Program that prints the numbers from 1 to 98 and in their hexadecimal form.
 - 5-print_comb2.py: Program that prints the numbers from 00 to 98 with a comma in between.
 - 6-print_comb3.py: Program that prints the different combinations of two digits in ascending order.
 - 7-islower.py: Function that checks if a given character is lowercase.
 - 8-uppercase.py: Function that converts a string to uppercase characters.
 - 9-print_last_digit.py: Function that prints the last digit of a number.
 - 10-add.py: Function that adds two numbers.
 - 11-pow.py: Function that calculates the $b^{th}$ power of the number $a$.
 - 12-fizzbuzz.py: Function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 and replaces the number with `Fizz` when it is divisible by 3, `Buzz`when it is divisible by 5, and `FizzBuzz` when it is divisible by 15.
 - 13-insert_number.c, lists.h: Function that inserts a number to a sorted list of numbers.
 - 100-print_tebahpla.py: Program that prints the alphabet in reverse and the odd indexed letters are printed in uppercase.
 - 101-remove_char_at.py: Function that removes a character at the position `n`.
 - 102-magic_calculation.py: Function that replicates the behavior from a given bytecode representation.
